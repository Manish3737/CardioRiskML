# CardioRiskML
Description HeartGuard is a data-driven application designed to predict an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using advanced machine learning algorithms in Python.
📌 Description
HeartGuard is a data-driven application designed to predict an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using advanced machine learning algorithms in Python. By leveraging clinical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, lifestyle habits, and more, HeartGuard empowers healthcare providers and patients with real-time, explainable insights to support early intervention and preventive care.

Built with tools like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and SHAP, and deployed via an interactive Streamlit dashboard, the project follows a complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and modeling to evaluation and interpretability.
